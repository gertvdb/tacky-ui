# Grid

<Canvas of={Stories.Complex} />

Our basic grid system is based on a configurable column layout, by default it uses 24 cols.
It is designed to be flexible and responsive, and can be used to create a wide variety of layouts.
This grid uses container queries to allow for more complex layouts, and is
designed to be used with the `Grid.Item` component.

## Some basic use cases

### Default

By default if you pass no params to the grid or the items, the items will fill the entire width of the grid without any gap, causing them to stack.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

### Basic

A more basic layout using the grid system

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

### Complex

A more complex layout using the grid system. This layout uses a combination of fixed widths and nested grids to create a more complex layout.

<Canvas of={Stories.Complex} />
