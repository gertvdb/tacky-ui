# Grid
<Canvas of={GridStories.Complex} />

Our basic grid system is based on a 12 column layout. It is designed to be
flexible and responsive, and can be used to create a wide variety of layouts.
This grid uses container queries to allow for more complex layouts, and is
designed to be used with the `Grid.Item` component.

## Props

An overview of both the props for the `Grid` and `Grid.Item` components.

### `Grid` Properties

- `gap`: Specifies the gap between grid items. This is a value from our spacing system.
- Breakpoints: The grid also has a number of breakpoints that can be used to change the layout at different screen sizes. These are `smBreakpoint`, `mdBreakpoint`, `lgBreakpoint`, `xlBreakpoint` and `xxlBreakpoint`. By default these will use the values of the [default Tailwind breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design), but since this grid uses container queries you can alter these to fit any content size.

### `Grid.Item` Properties

The only properties that are available for the `Grid.Item` component are the `initial` and the breakpoint props. These are used to specify the width of the item at different breakpoints.
Our breakpoints are mobile first, so the `initial` prop will be used for the smallest breakpoint and up, unless a specific breakpoint is set.

- `initial`: number;
- `sm`: number;
- `md`: number;
- `lg`: number;
- `xl`: number;
- `xxl`: number;

## Some basic use cases

### Default

By default if you pass no params to the grid or the items, the items will fill the entire width of the grid without any gap, causing them to stack.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Default} />

### Basic

A more basic layout using the grid system

<Canvas of={GridStories.Basic} />

### Complex

A more complex layout using the grid system. This layout uses a combination of fixed widths to create a more complex layout.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Complex} />
